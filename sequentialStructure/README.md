### 1. Sequential Structure

1.1 Make a Program that shows the message "Hello World" on the screen.

1.2 Make a Program that asks for a number and then displays the message "The number
informed was [number]".

1.3 Make a Program that asks for two numbers and prints the sum.

1.4 Make a Program that asks for the 4 bimonthly notes and shows the average.

1.5 Make a Program that converts meters to centimeters.

1.6 Make a Program that asks for the radius of a circle, calculates and shows its area.

1.7 Make a Program that calculates the area of ​​a square, then show the double
from this area to the user.

1.8 Make a Program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours
worked in the month. Calculate and show the total of your salary in that month.

1.9 Make a Program that asks for temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
show the temperature in degrees Celsius.
```
 C = (5 * (F-32) / 9).
```

1.10 Make a Program that asks for temperature in degrees Celsius, transform and show
in degrees Fahrenheit.

1.11 Make a Program that asks for 2 integers and a real number. Calculate and
show:

* a. the product of double the first with half of the second.
* b. the sum of the triple of the first with the third.
* c. the third raised to the cube.

1.12 Taking the height data of a person as input, construct an algorithm that
calculate your ideal weight using the following formula: ```(72.7 * height) - 58```

1.13 Given the height and sex of a person as input, construct a
algorithm that calculates your ideal weight using the following formulas:

* a. For men: (72.7 * h) - 58
* b. For women: (62.1 * h) - 44.7 (h = height)
* c. Ask the person's weight and tell them if they are in, above or below weight.


1.14 João Papo-de-Pescador, a good man, bought a microcomputer to
control the daily income of your job. Every time it brings a weight of
greater than that established by the fishing regulations of the state of São
Paulo (50 kilos) must pay a fine of R $ 4.00 per kilo surplus. John
you need to do a program that reads the variable weight (fish weight) and
check for excess. If there is, write to the excess variable and to the fine variable
the amount of the fine that John must pay. Otherwise show such variables with
the ZERO content.

1.15 Make a Program that asks how much you earn per hour and the number of hours
worked in the month. Calculate and show the total of your salary in that month,
since it is deducted 11% for the Income Tax, 8% for the INSS and
5% for the union, make a program that gives us:

* a. gross salary.
* b. how much he paid the INSS.
* c. how much he paid the union.
* d. the net salary.
* e. calculate the discounts and the net salary, as shown in the table below:

```
+ Gross Salary: R $
- IR (11%): R $
- INSS (8%): ​​R $
- Union (5%): R $
= Net Salary: R $

 Note: Gross Salary - Discounts = Net Salary.
```

1.16 Make a program for an ink shop. The program should request the size
in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that ink coverage is
of 1 liter for every 3 square meters and that the paint is sold in cans of 18
liters, which cost R $ 80,00. Inform the user of quantities of ink cans
purchased and the total price.

1.17 Make a Program for an Ink Shop. The program should request the size
in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that ink coverage is
of 1 liter for every 6 square meters and that the paint is sold in cans of 18
liters, which cost R $ 80,00 or in gallons of 3.6 liters, which cost R $ 25,00.
Inform the user of the quantities of paint to be purchased and their prices in 3 situations:

* a. buy only 18-liter cans;
* b. buy only gallons of 3.6 liters;
* c. mix cans and gallons, so that the price is the smallest.

Add 10% slack and always round the values ​​up, that is, consider full cans.

1.18 Make a program that asks for the size of a downloadable file (in MB) and
the speed of an Internet link (in Mbps), calculate and report the time
approximate file download using this link (in minutes).
