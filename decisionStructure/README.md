2.11 The Tabajara Organizations have decided to increase their salaries and oppose them to develop the program that will calculate the readjustments.
Make a program that receives the salary of a collaborator and the adjustment according to the following criterion, based on the current salary:

* wages up to $ 280.00 (including): increase of 20%
* salaries between R $ 280,00 and R $ 700,00: increase of 15%
* salaries between R $ 700.00 and R $ 1500.00: increase of 10%
* salaries of R $ 1500,00 onwards: increase of 5% After the increase is made, inform on the screen:
* the salary before readjustment;
* the percentage of increase applied;
* the amount of increase;
* the new salary, after the increase.


2.12 Make a program for the calculation of a payroll, knowing that the discounts are from the Income Tax, which depends on the gross salary (as per table below) and 3% for the Union, and that the FGTS corresponds to 11% of the Gross Salary , but it is not discounted (it is the company that deposits). The Net Salary corresponds to the Gross Salary minus the discounts. The program should ask the user for the amount of their time and the amount of hours worked in the month.
IR discount:
* Gross Salary up to 900 (inclusive) - exempt
* Gross Salary up to 1500 (inclusive) - 5%
* Gross Salary up to 2500 (inclusive) - 10% discount
* Gross Salary above 2500 - 20% discount Print on the screen the information, arranged according to the example below. In the example the time value is 5 and the amount of time is 220.

```
        Gross Salary: (5 * 220): R $ 1100.00
        (-) IR (5%): R $ 55.00
        (-) INSS (10%): R $ 110.00
        FGTS (11%): R $ 121.00
        Total discounts: R $ 165,00
        Net Salary: R $ 935,00
```

2.13 Make a Program that reads a number and displays the corresponding day of the week. (1-Sunday, 2- Monday, etc.), if you enter another value should appear invalid value.

2.14 Make a program that reads the two partial marks obtained by a student in a course over a semester, and calculate their average. The assignment of concepts obeys the table below:

```
  Average Utilization Concept
  Between 9.0 and 10.0 A
  Between 7.5 and 9.0 B
  Between 6.0 and 7.5 C
  Between 4.0 and 6.0 D
  Between 4.0 and zero E
```

* The algorithm should display the notes, the mean, the corresponding concept and the message "APPROVED" if the concept is A, B or C or "FAILED" if the concept is D or E.


2.15 Make a Program that asks for the 3 sides of a triangle. The program should tell you whether the values ​​can be a triangle. Indicate, if the sides form a triangle, if it is: equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
**Tips:**
* Three sides form a triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third;
* Triangle Equilateral: three equal sides;
* Isosceles triangle: any two sides equal;
* Scalene triangle: three different sides;


2.16 Make a program that calculates the roots of a second-degree equation, in the form ax2 + bx + c. The program should ask for the values ​​of a, b and c and make the consistencies, informing the user in the following situations:
```
The. If the user reports the value of A equal to zero, the equation is not of the second degree and the program should not ask for the other values, being closed;
a. If the calculated delta is negative, the equation has no real roots. Inform the user and exit the program;
b. If the calculated delta equals zero the equation has only one real root; inform the user;
c. If the delta is positive, the equation has two real roots; inform them to the user;
```

2.17 Make a Program that asks for a number corresponding to a given year, and then report whether or not this year is leap year.

2.18 Make a Program that asks for a date in the format dd / mm / yyyy and determine if it is a valid date.

2.19 Make a Program that reads an integer less than 1000 and prints the number of hundreds, tens, and units of it.
Looking at the plural terms the placement of the "e", the comma among others. Example:
* 326 = 3 hundreds, 2 tens and 6 units
* 12 = 1 tens and 2 units Test with: 326, 300, 100, 320, 310,305, 301, 101, 311, 111, 25, 20, 10, 21, 11, 1, 7, and 16

2.20 Make a Program for reading a student's three partial notes. The program should calculate the average attained per student and present:
```
a. The message "Approved", if the average is greater than or equal to 7, with the respective average reached;
b. The message "Disapproved", if the average is less than 7, with the respective average reached;
c. The "Approved with Distinction" message, if the mean is 10.
```

2.21 Make a Program for an ATM. The program should ask the user for the amount of the draw and then inform how many notes of each value will be provided. The available notes will be 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 reais. The minimum amount is 10 reais and the maximum is 600 reais. The program should not worry about the amount of notes on the machine.
* Example 1: To extract the amount of 256 reais, the program provides two 100 notes, a 50 note, a 5 note, and a 1 note;
* Example 2: To get the amount of 399 reais, the program provides three 100 notes, a 50 note, four 10 notes, a 5 note and four 1 notes.

2.22 Make a Program that asks for an integer and determines whether it is even or odd. Tip: Use the module operator (remainder of the division).

2.23 Make a Program that asks for a number and tells whether the number is integer or decimal. Tip: Use a rounding function.

2.24 Make a Program that reads 2 numbers and then ask the user which operation he wants to perform. The result of the operation shall be accompanied by a sentence stating whether the number is:
* even or odd;
* positive or negative;
* integer or decimal.

2.25 Make a program that asks 5 questions to a person about a crime. The questions are:
The. "Did you call the victim?"
a. "Been at the scene?"
b. "Do you live near the victim?"
c. "Should I for the victim?"
d. "Have you worked with the victim?" The program should in the end issue a classification about the person's participation in the crime. If the person responds positively to 2 questions it should be classified as "Suspicious", between 3 and 4 as "Accomplice" and 5 as "Assassin". Otherwise, it will be classified as "Innocent."

2.26 One station is selling fuels with the following discount chart:
* **Alcohol:**
- up to 20 liters, 3% discount per liter
- above 20 liters, 5% discount per liter
* **Gasoline:**
- up to 20 liters, 4% discount per liter
- above 20 liters, 6% discount per liter Write an algorithm that reads the number of liters sold, the type of fuel (coded as follows: A-alcohol, G-petrol), calculate and print the amount to be paid by the customer knowing that the price of the liter of gasoline is R $ 2,50 the price of the liter of alcohol is R $ 1,90.

             Up to 5 kg        Up to 5 kg
Strawberry  $ 2,50 per kg    $ 2,20 per kg
Apple       $ 1.80 per Kg    $ 1.50 per Kg
```

* If the customer buys more than 8 kg in fruit or the total value of the purchase exceeds $ 25.00, you will still receive a 10% discount on this total. Write an algorithm to read the amount (in kg) of strawberries and the amount (in kg) of purchased apples and write the amount to be paid by the customer.


2.28 The Hypermarket Tabajara has a meat promotion which is a must. Check out:
